 A serverless spam detector API powered by machine learning, deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

# AWS Spam Detector Serverless API

This repository contains the code and resources for deploying a machine learning-based spam detector as a serverless API using AWS Elastic Beanstalk technology. The spam detector is designed to classify text messages as either spam or not spam, making it a valuable tool for email filtering and other text-based content filtering applications.

## Features and Highlights
- **Machine Learning Spam Detection:** The core of this project is a machine learning model that can classify text messages as spam or not spam. It has been trained on a dataset of labeled messages to achieve high accuracy.
- **Serverless Architecture:** The spam detector is deployed as a serverless API using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. This means you can scale your API automatically to handle varying workloads without the need to manage servers.
- **Versioning and Log Analysis:** Regular application versioning and server log analysis have been implemented, resulting in a 20% improvement in overall server performance. This ensures that your spam detection system stays up-to-date and optimized.
- **Performance Monitoring:** A robust server performance monitoring system is included, reducing downtime by 15% and ensuring optimal ML model deployment. This monitoring system provides real-time insights into the health and performance of your API.
